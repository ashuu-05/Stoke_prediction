# Stroke_Prediction_Dataset

This project predicts stroke occurrence using a Kaggle healthcare dataset. I applied a complete machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover meaningful patterns. I handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding, then trained and fine-tuned classification models. Model performance was evaluated using F1 Score and ROC Curve, strengthening my skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and data storytelling.
